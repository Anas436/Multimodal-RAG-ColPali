# Multimodal-RAG-ColPali

In this project, I demonstrate how to use Qwen-2-VL-7B Instruct and ColPali for building a multimodal RAG engine. You'll learn how to process a PDF containing images and ask questions about those images. I also walked through the indexing process using ColPali, making document retrieval easy and efficient.
